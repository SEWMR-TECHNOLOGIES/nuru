# NURU WORKSPACE - CANCELLATION AND REFUND FRAMEWORK

**Effective Date: February 2025**

This framework applies to all organiser-to-vendor bookings processed through the Nuru escrow system. No custom free-text cancellation policies are permitted. All vendors must operate within this structured system.

---

## 1. Core Principles

- No booking is confirmed without payment.
- All refunds are calculated automatically by the platform.
- No refund is available within 48 hours of the event start time, except in cases of vendor cancellation.
- Vendor cancellation always overrides organiser penalties.
- Cancellation and disputes are separate processes. Cancellation is about change of mind. Disputes are about service failure. They are not the same.

---

## 2. Payment Structure

Every booking has two components:

- **Booking Deposit**: An upfront payment to secure the booking
- **Escrow Balance**: The remaining amount held in escrow until service delivery

The default structure is:

- 30 percent booking deposit
- 70 percent escrow balance

Nuru may adjust these percentages for certain service categories or high-value events, but the two-component structure remains the same.

---

## 3. Booking Deposit Rules

- The booking deposit exists to protect vendor preparation costs.
- The deposit becomes non-refundable based on the applicable cancellation tier and timeline.
- If the vendor cancels at any time, the full deposit is refunded to the organiser (100 percent).

---

## 4. Cancellation Tiers

All vendor services operate under one of three standardized tiers. The applicable tier is determined by the service category.

### Tier 1: Flexible

Recommended for low-preparation services such as MCs, photographers, and makeup artists.

**Organiser Cancellation Refund Rules:**

- More than 7 days before event: 100 percent refund of total amount
- 7 days to 48 hours before event: Deposit retained by vendor, 70 percent of escrow balance refunded to organiser
- Within 48 hours of event: No refund

### Tier 2: Moderate

Recommended for medium-cost services such as DJs, tent rental, and basic decor.

**Organiser Cancellation Refund Rules:**

- More than 14 days before event: 100 percent refund of total amount
- 14 days to 7 days before event: Deposit retained by vendor, 50 percent of escrow balance refunded to organiser
- 7 days to 48 hours before event: Deposit retained by vendor, no escrow refund
- Within 48 hours of event: No refund

### Tier 3: Strict

Recommended for high-upfront-cost services such as catering, large decor production, and stage construction.

**Organiser Cancellation Refund Rules:**

- More than 21 days before event: 100 percent refund of total amount
- 21 days to 14 days before event: Deposit retained by vendor, 50 percent of escrow balance refunded to organiser
- 14 days to 48 hours before event: Deposit retained by vendor, no escrow refund
- Within 48 hours of event: No refund

---

## 5. Universal 48-Hour Rule

Across all tiers, if cancellation occurs within 48 hours of the event start time, no refund is available under any circumstances, except in cases of vendor cancellation. This rule prevents event-day abuse.

---

## 6. Vendor Cancellation Rules

If a vendor cancels a confirmed booking:

- 100 percent refund to organiser (including booking deposit)
- Vendor receives a rating penalty
- Possible account strike

Repeat violations may result in:

- Temporary suspension
- Permanent removal for pattern abuse

If a vendor cancels within 7 days of the event:

- Nuru may deduct an additional penalty from the vendor's security deposit, if applicable

---

## 7. Force Majeure

Force majeure events include:

- Natural disasters
- Government bans or restrictions
- Serious medical emergencies (with documentation)
- War or civil unrest

If valid documentation is provided, Nuru may at its discretion:

- Allow a partial refund
- Facilitate rescheduling of the booking
- Override normal cancellation penalties

This decision is discretionary and made on a case-by-case basis.

---

## 8. Rescheduling

Instead of cancellation, an organiser may request to reschedule a booking.

- If the vendor agrees: No penalty is applied, funds remain in escrow, and the new date is updated
- If the vendor declines: Normal cancellation rules apply based on the applicable tier

---

## 9. High-Value Event Variations

For events above a defined threshold (for example, 3,000,000 TZS), Nuru may require:

- 40 percent deposit
- 60 percent escrow balance

Refund percentages adjust proportionally, but the tier logic and rules remain the same.

---

## 10. Platform Fee Handling During Cancellation

- If a booking is cancelled early and qualifies for a full refund, Nuru may deduct a small non-refundable processing fee.
- If cancellation falls within a penalty window, Nuru retains its commission only on the retained amount (not the refunded portion).
- All applicable fees are clearly disclosed before payment is processed.

---

## 11. Anti-Abuse Controls

To prevent manipulation of the cancellation system:

- Users cannot change an event date after booking to avoid cancellation penalties
- The cancellation timestamp is determined by the server, not the user's device
- All cancellation actions are logged permanently
- An organiser cannot cancel a booking after marking service as delivered

---

## 12. System Automation

All cancellation and refund calculations are performed automatically by the platform:

- Event start times are stored in UTC
- Cancellation windows are calculated precisely based on server time
- Refund logic is applied automatically without manual intervention
- Platform fees are deducted from refunded amounts as applicable
- All cancellation timestamps and actions are logged permanently
