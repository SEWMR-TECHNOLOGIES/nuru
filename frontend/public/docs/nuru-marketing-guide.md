# PAGE 1: BRAND OVERVIEW AND POSITIONING

## What is Nuru?

Nuru is an event planning workspace built for individuals and organizations who want to plan, manage, and execute events without the chaos of scattered tools. It brings together guest management, vendor booking, financial tracking, team coordination, and guest communication into one clean, mobile-friendly workspace.

Nuru is not just a tool for big events. It works for weddings, birthdays, corporate meetings, graduations, baby showers, funerals, anniversaries, religious ceremonies, concerts, and every other gathering that requires coordination.

## Who is Nuru For?

- **Event organizers** who plan personal or professional events and need structure
- **Service providers** (photographers, caterers, DJs, decorators, florists, MCs, equipment rental companies) who want to reach more clients and manage bookings
- **Committee members** who are assigned responsibilities for an event and need a shared workspace
- **Guests and contributors** who want to RSVP, contribute money, and stay informed about event details
- **Businesses** that run corporate events, product launches, or conferences

## Brand Voice

Nuru speaks with warmth, clarity, and professionalism. The tone is inclusive and respectful. Nuru treats every event with equal importance, whether it is a million-dollar wedding or a small family gathering. The language avoids jargon and speaks directly to real people solving real problems.

**Core messaging themes:**
- "Every moment deserves care."
- "Plan with clarity. Organize with ease."
- "Life is made of moments. Some we look forward to, others we prepare for quietly. Nuru is here to help you organize them all with dignity and care."

## What Makes Nuru Different?

1. **All-in-one workspace:** No need for separate apps for guest lists, budgets, vendor contacts, and invitations. Everything lives in one place.
2. **Verified service providers:** Every vendor on Nuru goes through a KYC verification process. Organizers can trust that providers are real businesses with real portfolios.
3. **WhatsApp and SMS integration:** Guests receive RSVP invitations and event updates directly on WhatsApp or SMS. No app download required to respond.
4. **Financial transparency:** Track contributions, pledges, and actual payments. See exactly how much has been collected, who has paid, and what the shortfall is.
5. **Committee collaboration:** Assign team members with specific permissions. Everyone sees what they need and nothing more.
6. **NFC smart cards:** Guests tap their phones on a Nuru Card to check in at the venue. No lines, no printed lists, no manual searches.
7. **Works for all event types:** From joyful celebrations to solemn memorials, Nuru handles them all with appropriate sensitivity.

# PAGE 2: PRODUCT FEATURES IN DETAIL

## 1. Event Creation and Management

Organizers create an event by selecting a type (Wedding, Birthday, Corporate, Graduation, Baby Shower, Funeral, Anniversary, Religious Event, Concert, or Other). They then fill in the event name, date, time, location, expected guest count, and budget.

Once created, the organizer gets a full management dashboard with tabs for:

- **Overview:** Budget summary, guest count, contribution progress, services booked, and overall event health at a glance
- **Guest List:** Add guests individually or import from contacts. Track RSVP status (Attending, Pending, Declined). Manage plus-ones. Export guest data.
- **Contributions:** Set contribution targets. Track pledges vs. actual payments. See a "Cash in Hand" summary showing total raised, number of paid contributors, outstanding balance, and collection rate.
- **Committee:** Add team members with role-based permissions. Assign responsibilities. Committee members get their own access to manage their assigned areas.
- **Schedule:** Build a detailed event schedule with time slots and descriptions. Share it with committee members and guests.
- **Checklist:** Pre-loaded task checklists based on event type. Custom tasks can be added. Track completion with progress bars.
- **Services:** Browse, compare, and book verified vendors directly from the event dashboard.

**Event statuses:** Draft, Confirmed, Published, Cancelled, Completed. Each status triggers appropriate actions and notifications.

## 2. Verified Service Providers Marketplace

Nuru has a built-in marketplace with 12 service categories:

| Category | Examples |

Each provider profile includes: service description, pricing, portfolio images, location, availability calendar, ratings, and client reviews. Providers must submit KYC documents (National ID, business registration, portfolio samples, tax compliance certificate) before being verified.

**For service providers:** Nuru gives you a professional online presence, a booking calendar, direct messaging with potential clients, and a verified badge that builds trust.

## 3. Digital Invitations and RSVP System

Organizers send invitations via SMS or WhatsApp. Each guest receives a unique 8-character RSVP code. Guests click the link and land on a simple, public-facing RSVP page where they can:

- Confirm attendance (Yes / No / Maybe)
- Select meal preferences from options set by the organizer
- List dietary restrictions or allergies
- Add special requests
- Indicate plus-ones (if allowed by the organizer)

No app download is needed. No login is needed. The guest taps the link, fills the form, and submits.

The organizer sees all responses in real time on their dashboard. They can generate branded RSVP reports with attendance summaries (Total Invited, Attending, Pending, Declined, Checked In).

## 4. WhatsApp Bot Integration

Nuru has a WhatsApp bot that handles guest interactions automatically. When a guest receives an invitation on WhatsApp, they can reply with simple keywords:

- **YES** to confirm attendance
- **NO** to decline
- **DETAILS** to get event information (date, time, location)
- **HELP** to see available options

The bot greets guests by name, using the name stored in the database (not the WhatsApp profile name). It uses proper titles (Dr., Prof., Eng., Mheshimiwa) when addressing guests. All bot messages end with the Nuru signature: "Nuru: Plan Smarter."

## 5. Financial Management

Every event has a financial dashboard showing:

- **Budget:** The planned total spend
- **Pledged:** How much contributors have promised
- **Collected:** How much has actually been received
- **Shortfall:** The gap between budget and collected funds
- **Cash in Hand:** Total raised with breakdown by paid contributors, outstanding balance, and collection rate percentage

Organizers can set contribution targets, allow anonymous contributions, set minimum contribution amounts, and track who has paid versus who has only pledged.

## 6. NFC Smart Cards (Nuru Cards)

Nuru Cards are physical NFC-enabled cards that guests tap on their phones to:

- Check in at the event venue instantly
- Access the event schedule and venue details
- Share contact information with other guests
- Sign a digital guest book

Cards come in Regular and Premium designs. Organizers order cards through Nuru by specifying cardholder names, selecting design templates, and providing delivery details. Each card gets a unique number (format: NURU-YYYY-XXXXXX).

## 7. Social Features

Nuru has a social feed where users can:

- Post event moments (photos and text updates)
- Like, comment, and share posts
- Follow other users
- View public profiles with follower counts, event counts, and moments
- Save posts for later
- Share posts publicly via links (no login needed to view shared posts)

Public profiles are accessible at nuru.tz/u/username and show the user's moments, published events, and services.

## 8. Nuru Chatbot

A built-in AI assistant that helps users navigate the platform. It provides personalized greetings, service recommendations, and answers to common questions. The chatbot supports markdown tables, fullscreen mode on desktop, and displays user avatars.

# PAGE 3: VALUE PROPOSITIONS BY AUDIENCE

## For Event Organizers

**Problem:** Planning an event means juggling phone calls, WhatsApp groups, spreadsheets, handwritten guest lists, and mental notes. Important details get lost. Budgets go untracked. Vendors get mixed up.

**Nuru's solution:**

- One workspace for your entire event. No switching between apps.
- See your budget, guest count, and task progress on a single dashboard.
- Send invitations with one click and track who has responded.
- Assign tasks to committee members and monitor completion.
- Book verified vendors directly, with reviews and portfolios to guide your choice.
- Track every contribution down to the last shilling. Know exactly where your money is.
- Get branded reports you can share with your committee or sponsors.

**Key message:** "Stop planning your event in 10 different places. Nuru puts everything in one workspace so you can focus on what matters."

## For Service Providers

**Problem:** Finding new clients is expensive. Managing bookings across phone calls and DMs is messy. Building trust with new clients takes time.

**Nuru's solution:**

- Create a professional profile with your portfolio, pricing, and availability.
- Get verified with a badge that signals trust to potential clients.
- Receive booking requests directly on the platform.
- Manage your calendar and avoid double-bookings.
- Chat with clients through built-in messaging.
- Get reviews from past clients that help you win new ones.

**Key message:** "Let your work speak for itself. Get verified, get found, get booked."

## For Guests and Contributors

**Problem:** You get a WhatsApp message about an event. You want to confirm attendance but there is no simple way to do it. You want to contribute money but you are not sure if it went through. You arrive at the venue and wait in a long line to check in.

**Nuru's solution:**

- Tap a link to RSVP in 30 seconds. No app download, no login.
- Contribute money with a clear record of your payment.
- Reply to the WhatsApp bot with "YES" to confirm attendance instantly.
- Tap your Nuru Card at the venue and walk right in.

**Key message:** "One tap to RSVP. One tap to check in. Nuru makes attending events as smooth as it should be."

## For Committees and Event Teams

**Problem:** You are part of the planning committee but you do not know what others are doing. The organizer keeps forgetting to update you. You are not sure what budget remains.

**Nuru's solution:**

- See your assigned tasks and deadlines in the workspace.
- Access the guest list, contributions, and schedule based on your permissions.
- Get notified when something changes.
- Communicate with the team inside Nuru instead of scattered WhatsApp groups.

**Key message:** "Everyone on the same page. No confusion, no missed tasks, no surprises."
